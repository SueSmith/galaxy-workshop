# Guidelines for the Workshop Host

## General Public Speaking Tips

- Warm up your body and speech an hour before the workshop
- Get your energy up and turn your nervousness into excitement
- Speak loudly, clearly, and not too fast - most especially if you’re speaking English in a non-native-English speaking city
- Pause more than you think you need to, in order to allow the audience time to digest, and enable more emphasis when you are speaking
- Repetition will help your audience understand something, so repeat the context, definitions, and concepts

## General Workshop Tips

### Manage the context

- Establish context, orientation, and explicitly narrate your actions when moving through the UI
- Re-establish context when switching windows, tools, projects, or tasks
- Avoid switching rapidly between screens and practice transitions beforehand
- Repeat the instructions several times for the audience (or reference written instructions)
- Gradually and judiciously introduce new context and resources

### Engage the audience

- Poll the audience initially to gauge their level of expertise and personas
- Poll the audience periodically (with your hand raised) to see how relevant the topic is for this particular audience
- If you ask the audience a question, make it clear that you’re expecting an answer (not rhetorical)
- Periodically encourage participants to ask questions; don’t let anyone remain stuck for too long or they will become disengaged and it’s hard to re-gain their attention
- End with claps

## Maintain your pace

- Allow time for questions according to your preference - you can choose to answer as you go along, or to answer at periodic stopping points
- Read the room; if everyone scrunches up their face in confusion - pause to repeat or clarify the material; if everyone seems disengaged or antsy - pause for a break or a change of pace
- Allow the participants to have periodic “wins” and something in their workspace so they can go back to work with something tangible to reference
